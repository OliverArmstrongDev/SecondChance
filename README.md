# SecondChance
<br>
I created this in 2010 as an application to backup, restore and upload databases to FTP.
At the time only expensive solutions existed (and the business owner didn't like spending money on IT software) so I spent the time building this solution.
<br><br>
We used this to backup the databases on our local SQL server (possibly some client sites too (I can't remember).
<br><br>
It connected to local SQL databases and used Scheduled tasks (built-in to Windows) to run backups on a schedule.

I even made a customised installer for the application itself.
